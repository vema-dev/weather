# Vema Weather App

This is only demo project. Some helpers like api are not nessesary, fetch is good enough :) Although it may come in handy in the future. I created this app long time ago just to recall React. I uploaded it here, maybe it will be helpfull for someone :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For tests you can use this API key: e6c98ec82484a6588cd1ba7f002ee096. If the key didn't work, then you can generate it on openweathermap.org website.
